Technology Stack:
 Spring Boot latest for developing independent microservices.
 Spring Security with JWT.  for secure authentication and role-based access control.
 MySQL/PostgreSQL for transactional data and MongoDB for flexible storage of non-relational data.
 Spring Cloud for microservice discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance.
 React.js/Angular for front-end (optional), providing a modern user interface.
